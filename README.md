# Small Basic Flappy Bird

**Description:** A recreation of Flappy Bird with Mircosoft Small Basic. Flappy Bird WAS NOT created by me, all credit goes to Dong Nguyen.

**Background:** During an 'Intro to Programming' course at school, I wanted to challenge myself to code Flappy Bird in Mircosoft Small Basic.

**Edit the game:** Open the FlappyBird.sb file through Mircosoft Small Basic if you wish to see the code.

*Warning:*  If you have any AV software enabled, it will most likely delete the FlappyBird.exe file, however, the program is harmless. I was required to temporarily disable mine to run/test the game. Even if the .sb file is run from Small Basic, it will also detect and remove that.
  
**Side note:**
- The program needs to restart each game, so it is functional, but not conveniently playable.
 - Sound effects were left out becuase they are difficult to implement with Small Basic.
