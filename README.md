# Small Basic Flappy Bird

**Description:** A recreation of Flappy Bird with Mircosoft Small Basic. Flappy Bird WAS NOT created by me, all credit goes to Dong Nguyen.

**Background:** During an Intro to Programming course at school, I wanted to challenge myself to code Flappy Bird in Mircosoft Small Basic.

**Edit the game:** Open the FlappyBird.sb file through Mircosoft Small Basic if you wish to see the code.

*Warning:* My AV software had to be disabled to run/test the game. If you have any AV software enabled, it will most likely delete the FlappyBird.exe file. However, the program is harmless. If the .sb file is run from Small Basic, it will also detect that, despite it being just code for the game.
  
**Side note:**
- The program needs to restart each game, so I would not consider it a complete game.
 - Sound effects were left out as a result of them being difficult to implement with Small Basic.
